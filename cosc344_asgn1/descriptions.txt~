I have chosen the New World Supermarket for my miniworld.
My database will keep track of employees, departments, customers
and products.
The supermarket is organized into departments. Each department has
a unique name, a unique number, a contact number and an employee
who manages the department. The start date of when that employee begins
managing the department is also recorded, as is the number of employees
in each department.

Each department has a number of products, each with their own
name, unique ID number, price, aisle and quantity.

The database will keep track of customers, including
their name, address, sex, ssn and contact number..

Employees have their name, ird number (Social Security number or Ssn),
address, salary, sex, birth date stored. An employee is assigned to one
department. The number of hours they work per week is also recorded.
Supervisors are also recorded.

Each customer's shopping list is recorded as a weak entity type (as customer
and product both need to exist for there to be a shopping list). Shopping lists
include the ssn number of a customer, multivalued key ProductID to identify
products and Price to record many products for each customer. Total number
of purchased products for the whole list is recorded. The total bill is
calculated as a derived attribute.
