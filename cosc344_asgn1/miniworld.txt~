I have chosen the New World Supermarket for my miniworld.
My database will keep track of employees, departments, customers
and products.
The supermarket is organized into departments. Each department has
a unique name, a unique number and an employee who manages the
department. The start date of when that employee begins
managing the department is also recorded.

Each department has a number of products, each with their own unique
name, unique number, and a certain aisle number.

The database will keep track of customers and their purchases, including
their name, address, sex, ssn and birthday.

Employees have their name, ird number (Social Security number or Ssn),
address, salary, sex, birthday stored. An employee is assigned to one
department. The number of hours they work per week is also recorded.
Supervisors are also recorded.
